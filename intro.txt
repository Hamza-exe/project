   Git is a distributed version control system. Version control systems are a
    category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to
    source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every
    modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is
    made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of
    the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team
    members
